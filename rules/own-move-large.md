# own-move-large

## id
own-move-large

## severity
critical

## trigger
Move large types instead of copying; use `Box` if moves are expensive. Trigger when working on ownership and borrowing and the code shows `own`-class risk.

## bad
```rust
// Large struct moved repeatedly = expensive memcpy each time
struct GameState {
    board: [[Cell; 100]; 100],  // 10,000 cells
    history: [Move; 1000],       // 1,000 moves
    players: [Player; 4],        // Player data
    // Total: potentially tens of KB
}

fn process_state(state: GameState) -> GameState {
    // Moving ~40KB+ of data
    let mut new_state = state;  // Memcpy here
    new_state.apply_rules();
    new_state  // Memcpy on return
}

let state = GameState::new();
let state = process_state(state);  // Two large memcpys
```

## good
```rust
// Box reduces move cost to 8 bytes
struct GameState {
    board: Box<[[Cell; 100]; 100]>,  // Pointer to heap
    history: Vec<Move>,               // Already heap-allocated
    players: [Player; 4],
}

fn process_state(mut state: GameState) -> GameState {
    // Moving just pointers + small inline data
    state.apply_rules();
    state  // Cheap move
}

// Or use Box at call site for one-off cases
fn process_large(state: Box<LargeStruct>) -> Box<LargeStruct> {
    // 8-byte move regardless of LargeStruct size
    state
}
```

## when
Apply when the rule's pattern is visible in production code, public API, hot path, or reusable library surface.

## when_not
Do not apply mechanically when it obscures intent, weakens correctness, or conflicts with local constraints.

## verification
Add focused tests or static checks that prove the intended behavior and prevent regression.
